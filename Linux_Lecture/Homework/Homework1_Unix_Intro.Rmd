Save a digital record of your work so that you can study it later if you need to 

1. Open up a terminal and execute the following using UNIX commands
    - print your working directory
    - navigate to the homework1 working directory
    -copy a version of example_gff.tsv to a folder in your home diectory you want to work in
    - use at least 3 different UNIX commands to look at all or parts of `example_gff.tsv`
    - how many lines does `example_gff.tsv` have?
  
    - how many lines in the file begin with "LG5"

    - replace all instances of "LG" with "linkage_group" and print to the terminal
   
    - capture fields 1, 2, and 9 and write to a new file called `3_cols.tsv`
